LINKED LIST - Time Complexity

INSERTION OPERATIONS
Insertion at the Beginning: O(1)
Insertion at the End (without tail pointer): O(n)
Insertion at the End (with tail pointer): O(1)
Insertion at a Specific Position: O(n)

DELETION OPERATIONS
Deletion at the Beginning (Head): O(1)
Deletion at the End (Tail): O(n) (without tail pointer)
Deletion at the End (Tail): O(1) (with tail pointer, but still requires traversal for the second-to-last node)
Deletion at a Specific Position: O(n)
Deletion of a Specific Node (Given a Pointer): O(1)

SEARCH AND TRAVERSAL OPERATIONS
Search - O(n)
Traveral - O(n)

STACK - Time Complexity

push - O(1)
pop - O(1)
peek - O(1)
is_empty - O(1)


QUEUE - Time Complexity

enqueue - O(1)
dequeue - O(1)
peek - O(1)
is_empty - O(1)
size - O(1)
